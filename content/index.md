title: Welcome to the Queer NDIS Guide
---
This will be the future home to a resource for queer disabled folks. It will detail not just how to get onto the NDIS, but also provide information for those already on the scheme. This will include both a whitelist of known good providers, and a blacklist of known bad providers. It also may help you learn how to advocate for yourself better.



See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started.
